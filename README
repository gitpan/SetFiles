Notes for version 1.00
  This is the initial release.


This is a module for working with simple sets of elements where each set is
defined in a separate file (one file for each set to be defined).

The advantages of putting each set in a separate file are:

1) Set managment can be delegated

If all sets are defined in a single file, management of all sets must be
done by a single user, or by using a suid program.  By putting each set in
a separate file, different files can be owned by different users so
management of different sets can be delegated.

2) Set files are a simple format

Because a file consists of a single set only, there is no need to have a
complex file format which has to be parsed to get information about the
set.  As a result, set files can easily be autogenerated or edited with
any simple text editor, and errors are less likely to be introduced into
the file.
